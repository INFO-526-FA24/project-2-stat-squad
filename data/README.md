# Data Folder

This folder contains the dataset used for analyzing optimizer dynamics in deep learning models. The data captures various metrics for gradient descent optimizers across different types of optimization landscapes.

## Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Name**: [Provide dataset name here]
- **Description**: This dataset includes simulated and/or real-world data to explore how different optimizers behave on specific loss surfaces. The variables cover various performance metrics like convergence time, final loss values, and parameter settings.

## Codebook

### Variables and Descriptions

- **Optimizer**: Name of the optimizer (e.g., "SGD," "Adam," "RMSProp").
- **Learning Rate**: The rate at which the optimizer adjusts weights during training.
- **Iterations**: The total number of iterations taken for convergence.
- **Final Loss**: The loss value after optimization.
- **Surface Type**: Type of loss landscape (e.g., "convex," "non-convex," "saddle-point").
