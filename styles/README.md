# Styles Folder

This folder contains stylesheet files (e.g., `.css`, `.scss`) used to define the visual appearance and design of the project’s web-based components.

## Contents

- **Stylesheets**: Custom CSS files for styling the project’s web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and overall design aesthetics.
- **Other Style Files**: Additional styling formats (if any, e.g., SCSS, LESS) used for more advanced or modular styling.

These files help ensure consistency in the visual presentation across various components of the project.
